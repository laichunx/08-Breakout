my paddle ball game.

I create this game by modifiying the Scripting assignment. 

I added a 2 seconds pause to let the player to get ready for the game before the game begin.

One more level is added into the game, which can only be access if the player lose the game. When the player lose, there are three buttons for player to choose. 

The first one is play the level 1 again, the second one is play the level 2, and the third is quit the game.

Also, I modified the speed of the ball twice faster than before, which is more similar to the actual paddle ball game. 

Moreover, I added a cloner ball which clone the original ball when having collision with it. The clones will not reduce player's lives when they are out of screen. And the cloner ball will respawn if it dies.

Overall, I think this project is interesting, and it helps me to get familiar with Godot.
